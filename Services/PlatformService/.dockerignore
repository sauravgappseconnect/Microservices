# Exclude all files, but re-include specific ones (order matters)
# This pattern first excludes everything, then selectively includes necessary files.
# Use with caution, as it can be tricky to manage.
# For example, to include only 'src' directory and 'package.json':
# **
# !src/
# !src/**/*
# !package.json

**/bin/
**/obj/
